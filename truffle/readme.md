# Truffle container

Latest version of truffle because why not. Nothing will break for sure! (Should really use fix one version of truffle, but we can get to it when something does break).

Truffle is run in a docker container to make version switching easier, and because requiring local installation of truffle/node to be of a particular verison is a pain.
